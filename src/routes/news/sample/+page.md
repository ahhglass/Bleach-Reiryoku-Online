## First news post

This is a sample news entry. You can add more by creating folders under `src/routes/news/` with a `+page.md` file.

### How to add news

1. Create a folder with a slug name (e.g. `update-0-2-0`).
2. Add a `+page.md` file inside it.
3. Add frontmatter at the top: `slug`, `title`, `date`, `excerpt`, and optionally `coverImage`, `tags`, `updated`.

**Markdown** is supported: lists, headings, *italic*, **bold**, links and images.
